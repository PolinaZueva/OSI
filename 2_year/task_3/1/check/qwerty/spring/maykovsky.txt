Your thought,
dreaming on a softened brain,
like a fat lackey on a greasy couch,
I will tease on a bloody rag of a heart:
I mock to my fill, impudent and caustic.
I have not a single gray hair in my soul,
and there is no senile tenderness in it!
Having thundered the world with the power of my voice,
I go - handsome,
twenty-two years old.
Tender!
You put love on violins.
The rude one puts love on timpani.
But you cannot turn yourself out, like me,
so that there were only solid lips!
Come and study -
from the drawing room cambric,
a prim official of the angelic league.
And who calmly turns over her lips,
like a cook the pages of a cookbook.
If you want, I will go mad from meat, and, like the sky, changing tones, 
if you want, I will be impeccably gentle, not a man, but a cloud in trousers! 
I do not believe that there is a floral Nice! 
I am again praised by men, stale as a hospital, and women, worn out as a proverb.
